# Python_enablement_doc_Live_Iot_data
This project is designed to be an enablement asset for users just starting out with data science, Python, Jupyter notebooks, and IBM's Watson Studio.  In it, I use python in a Jupyter notebook to replicate an SPSS model that trains a split model on a variable using linear regression.  

The notebook is intended for users with no prior background in data science or Python to learn the basics by working with a data set to build a simple linear regression model and evaluate the model's accuracy, commonly referred to as the goodness-of-fit of the model.  Code is written in a jupyter notebook so the user will also build a basic understanding of jupyter notebooks, which IBM's Watson Studio offering is based on.  IBM's Watson Studio is a collaborative environment for data scientists in an organization that allows for seamless sharing of data and code to greatly improve the efficiency of data science teams producing business value driving models.

In the notebook, I do the data science work using the pandas, numpy, and sci-kit learn libraries.  I go through all phases of a data science project, from ingesting data to performing data cleansing, splitting data, model building, and evaluating the model's goodness of fit.  You'll see data type instantiation, data exploration, a data time lag, and ultimately the training and evaluation of a split model using linear regression.
